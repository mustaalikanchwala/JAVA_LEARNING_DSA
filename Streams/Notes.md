Streams in Java are a way to process collections of data (like lists or arrays) in a simple, clean, and efficient manner. 
Think of a stream as a pipeline where data flows through and gets transformed step by step.

Aspect        |  Collections                                   |  Streams                                           
--------------+------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------
Purpose       |  Store and group data in memory                |  Perform operations like filtering, mapping on data
Storage       |  Hold all elements in memory (List, Set, Map)  |  Don't store data; process from a source           
Modification  |  Can add or remove elements                    |  Cannot modify; only produce results               
Reusability   |  Can traverse multiple times                   |  Consumable once; must recreate to use again       
Iteration     |  External iteration (you write loops)          |  Internal iteration (Stream API handles it)        
Computation   |  All elements computed before adding           |  Elements computed on demand (lazy)                
Package       |  java.util package                             |  java.util.stream package                          

Usecases for Streams
1. Filtering
2. Mapping
3. Aggregation
4. Searching
5. Iteration    

Stream Pipeline
Source => intermediate Opertion => Terminal Operation
intermediate operation will excute only if terminal operation are there 
intermediate operation are lazy

collect(Collectors.toList()) returns a mutable list (usually an ArrayList) that you can modify after creation. This means you can add, remove, or change elements in the resulting list.â€‹

toList() returns an immutable list that cannot be modified. If you try to add or remove elements, it will throw an UnsupportedOperationException.
